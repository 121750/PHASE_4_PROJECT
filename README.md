This helps businesses maintain relevance and increase profits
This project aims to solve a real-world problem by building an NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiments about Apple and Google products. This project will help companies gain insights into how customers are talking about their products and services on Twitter and use those insights to drive business decisions. This is important since social media platforms like Twitter have become a popular medium for customers to express their thoughts and feelings about products and services. Companies need to monitor these conversations to understand how customers perceive their products and services and use them to make informed business decisions.
